#Project details
--------------------
This project is created to sharpe my knowledge in Next.js and to learn MUI from scratch to advanced level.

Through out this practice session, I will use git and github very deeply to get myself comfortable with this version control system.

Also, what I have learn so far on clean code will be applied here.

## Time and deadline

So it seems that, it;s gonna be a very large practice session. that's why I don't wanna set a deadline for this particular session because, here my goal is to make my self comfortable with Next.js, MUI, WP rest api as well as git and github.
